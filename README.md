# QuickConstant

This repository contains a c++ code that computes the dissociation and association constants, with units mol/liter and liter/mol respectively, based upon a simple 2 bead simulation with periodic boundary conditions. The coordinate files are expected to be in XYZ format i.e.
```
2
Atoms. Timestep: 0
1 <x1> <y1> <z1>
1 <x2> <y2> <z2>
```
where `<x>, <y>, <z>` are the cartesian coordinates.

# Usage

This repository contains an executable ***quicksort***
